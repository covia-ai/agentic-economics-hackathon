> **Agents shouldn’t just answer questions – they should coordinate, contract, and transact.**

This project is our exploration of what happens when you give AI agents:
- a shared orchestration grid,
- a real system of record,
- and the ability to form and execute **economic contracts**.

For the **MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon – Track 1**, we use the **Covia Federated Orchestration Grid** together with **MCP**, **Anthropic Claude**, **Cursor**, and (optionally) **Gemini** to let agents:

- negotiate terms,
- draft and validate economic contracts,
- and execute them end-to-end across tools and providers.

Our goal is simple: show a glimpse of what **agentic economics** looks like when you move beyond glue code and brittle workflows, and treat agents as **economic actors** operating on top of a shared grid.


## Agentic Economic Contracting with Covia.ai (MCP Hackathon – Track 1)

Agents shouldn’t just answer questions – they should coordinate, contract, and transact.

This project explores what becomes possible when you give AI agents:
• a shared orchestration grid,
• verified, governed tool access via MCP,
• multi-provider cognitive capabilities (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini),
• Manus-powered tool execution,
• and a real, append-only system of record.

For the MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon (Track 1), we built a prototype where agents
negotiate, draft, validate, and execute economic contracts — end-to-end — across Anthropic, OpenAI, Manus, and the Covia Grid.

This is our first glimpse of agentic economics: agents acting as economic participants, not chatbots.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an agentic economic coordination system built using:
	•	MCP (Model Context Protocol) for unified tool/model interoperability
	•	Anthropic Claude for negotiation + reasoning
	•	OpenAI tools for structured execution
	•	Google Gemini (optional) for multimodal analysis
	•	Covia.ai Federated Orchestration Grid for shared memory, contract state machines, and a governed system of record

What the agents actually do

Agents:
	1.	Propose economic terms
	2.	Negotiate until agreement
	3.	Draft a structured JSON contract
	4.	Validate through Claude/Cusror + MCP
	5.	Execute actions using Claude tools
	6.	Commit all state to the Covia Grid
	7.	Produce an auditable, append-only ledger

This is a proof-of-concept for multi-agent, multi-LLM economic coordination.

## How We Used MCP (Track 1 Requirements)

This submission is built specifically for Track 1: Build with MCP.

We use MCP in three ways:

### A. MCP as the universal transport layer

MCP lets Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, and Manus communicate through:
	•	a shared message schema
	•	unified tool calling
	•	model-agnostic interoperability
	•	consistent tool validation responses

This removes 90% of typical agent-framework brittleness.

### B. MCP + Claude for safe tool execution

Claude is our MCP server providing:
	•	contract validation tools
	•	economic rule enforcement
	•	secure sandboxed execution
	•	deterministic error handling

All tool calls go through MCP → Claude/Cursor → Covia for recording.

⸻

### C. MCP as the foundation of agent-to-agent coordination

Agents provide tool outputs to each other via MCP events, including:
	•	contract drafts
	•	negotiation summaries
	•	validation results
	•	execution confirmations

MCP ensures everything has a consistent, verifiable structure.
